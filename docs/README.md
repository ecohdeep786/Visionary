# Visionary Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Visionary project.

## 📄 Files

- **STRUCTURE.md** - Detailed explanation of the project structure, file organization, import patterns, and best practices
- **API.md** - API endpoints, authentication, and service documentation (coming soon)
- **COMPONENTS.md** - Component library documentation and usage examples (coming soon)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines and development workflow (coming soon)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Understand the structure**: Read [STRUCTURE.md](./STRUCTURE.md)
2. **Adding a feature**: Follow the feature development workflow in STRUCTURE.md
3. **Using components**: See components guide (coming soon)
4. **Contributing**: Check CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines (coming soon)

## 📌 Key Points

- **Feature-based architecture** - Each feature is self-contained
- **Path aliases** - Use `@/` prefix for all imports (e.g., `@/features/home`)
- **Shared vs. Feature-specific** - Use `src/components/` and `src/lib/` for shared code
- **Testing** - Tests mirror the src structure under `src/__tests__/`

## 💡 Need Help?

- Check STRUCTURE.md for detailed explanations
- Look at existing features as examples
- Follow the established patterns
- Update documentation when adding new patterns
